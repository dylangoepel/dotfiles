# dotfiles
My dotfiles.

# Installation
You can simply install the dotfiles (and the required software) on arch linux systems by running ```make ```
inside the directory you cloned this repository into. If you want to modify them dotfiles a little bit,
make your changes and then run ```make``` again. This command will only reapply the modified configuration files.
